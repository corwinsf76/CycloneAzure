# MANUAL GIT COMMANDS TO FIX AZURE DEVOPS REMOTE

# 1. First, completely remove the existing remote connection
#    This command deletes the "origin" remote entirely
git remote remove origin

# 2. Verify that the remote has been removed
#    This command should show nothing if the remote was successfully removed
git remote -v

# 3. Add the correct remote URL for your Azure DevOps repository
git remote add origin https://justinlaughlin@dev.azure.com/justinlaughlin/cyclonev2/_git/cyclonev2

# 4. Verify that the new remote is correctly set
#    This should show the new URL you just added
git remote -v

# 5. Push your code to Azure DevOps
#    This pushes your main branch to the repository
git push -u origin main

# When prompted for your password, use your Personal Access Token (PAT)
# not your regular password.
